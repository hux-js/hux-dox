Version 0.1.0 has just been released to NPM. As this is 0.* versioned this is to be considered a development version and in other words, unstable as APIs are likely to change without warning and it is not bug-free.

We will work towards getting a stable 1.0.0 release as soon as possible. If you'd like to help please it would be hugely appreciated! We have contributing guidelines [here](https://github.com/hux-js/hux/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) and will be listing any issues available for pickup [here](https://github.com/hux-js/hux/issues).
