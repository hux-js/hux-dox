Version 0.1.0 has just been released to NPM. As this is 0.* versioned this is to be considered a development version and in other words, unstable. 

We will work towards getting a stable 1.0.0 release as soon as possible. If you'd like to help please do so. We have contributing guidelines [here](https://github.com/hux-js/hux/issues) and will be listing any issues available for pickup [here](https://github.com/hux-js/hux/issues).
